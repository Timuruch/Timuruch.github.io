        <h2 align="center">TNS will get closed?</h2>
        <p>
            Yeah, it's true. I decided to close TNS for works and even deleting but protocol<br>
            will stil alive. And i'm glad to introduce TimuruchNewsProtocolSystem it's updated<br>
            lighter and stornger to hacker atacks and the biggest inovation is that everybody can<br>
            use it for their plans. For example you need to get information(How many persons is now<br>
            on T-Live main server) by using requests you can do it now even with out admin access if<br>
            the content is legal.  
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">What new security do you improved?</h2>
        <p>
            So we added a new versions manager named VVFE(VerifyVersionsForEveryone) but now it's<br>
            on beta. I think you have asked a question How it will works? Everything is simple<br>
            first of all you need to get requests on version folder and the test if your verion<br>
            comparible just by testing in if because if not the text or data can show not corectly<br>
            and the when you tested the version you can dowload text or data tha you want.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center">How it will work with updates?</h2>
        <p>
            So update means just downloading dictionary and other security stuff and changing veriosn<br>
            number. When we will release Mager i'm going to optimaze updating by magazine.<br>
